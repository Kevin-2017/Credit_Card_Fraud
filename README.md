# A brief self-introduction<br>
My name is Kevin, a high school student. I have a strong interest in machine learning and codes.<br>
I want to present my projects and codes in github.<br>



# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-Project
## What is credit card fraud
Credit card fraud is a wide-ranging term for theft and fraud committed using or involving a payment card,<br>
such as a credit card or debit card, as a fraudulent source of funds in a transaction. It is of importance<br>
to detect such fraud via some novel methods. Here we will apply several `machine learning algorithms` to make prediction.<br>

## Dataset
The datasets(creditcard.csv) contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by european cardholders.<br> 
This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions.<br> 
The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions.<br>


## Experience
This project actually inspire me a lot, by showing the data, analyzed it, droping some of unnecessarily feature, imported the data to a model. I kind of have an Ideal of machine learning. Then in the porcess of improment,I used the ROC Cruve,  try to different result by changing the thearted hold. This is my first Python project, the results might not be perfect, but by getting over the challenge,I had learned a lot, also it's very exciting when I finally fished this.


## Key Results
The datasets was 98.4mb, which mean it contain mass of data, sp during the project I try to make all the  important part visaulize. <br> 
From the graph we can tell that the data is extremely unbalanced, they are 99.8% was normal, and only 0.172% frauds. I try to seperate data to smaller test group and droping some feature to increase speed and accuracy. It worked, the program correctly detect 92% of the fraud. <br>
It is high, but not perfect. I hope in the future I can learn more skill, and get 98% or even 99% accuracy.
